				<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: 400;">Ahoy
					there, fellow navigator!</span> Welcome to my internet expanse.
				You might notice a seeming emptiness, but do not fret. You've
				simply arrived early enough to witness the expansion of this
				universe. Just as the physical universe materialized from the Big
				Bang, this website will similarly unfold from this point. Emerging
				from this singularity will bloom a new digital universe!

				An abstract datatype <code>f a</code>, which has the ability for
				its value(s) to be mapped over, can become an instance of the
				<code>Functor</code> typeclass. That is to say, a new Functor,
				<code>f b</code>, can be made from <code>f a</code> by transforming
				all of its value(s), whilst leaving the structure of <code>f</code>
				itself unmodified.
